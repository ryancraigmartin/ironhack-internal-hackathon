Each team will have one UX/UI Designer and four Developers. The goal is to redesign Ironhack Miami landing page (https://www.ironhack.com/en/locations/miami). In the end, each team will present their work in 5 minutes or less and judges will decide who is the winner. 


Letâ€™s have fun and learn as much as possible from each other. 


Agenda:

A. For the first 20 minutes the designer explains to the fellow developers how they got into the process of creating a landing page:
- Who is the client? 
- What is the problem that they are trying to solve?
- Who are the target users?
- What are the goals you are trying to accomplish with this design?
	
	1. Explain the Design Thinking Process: 
		a. Empathize	
		b. Define
		c. Ideate
		d. Prototype 
		f. Test
	
	2. Explain the process of creating the landing page from the designer perspective.
 
B. Designers in 30 minutes makes low fidelity sketch of landing page on a piece of paper and explains their approach 
    and why they made changes to the original. Developers express their opinion too (from the perspective of a developer, 
    as in how likely is this change doable).

C. For the next 30 minutes, designers work on a mid fidelity and developers code the bones of the page using Bootstrap
    and/or Flexbox.

D. For the next 30 minutes, designers build a high fidelity prototype (including Mood Board and Style Tile). Developers will 
    code based on mid fidelity.

F. Last 30 minutes, developers apply colors and styles from the high fidelity prototype and the designer keeps an eye on the 
    process. Here developers will explain to the designer their approach and their code.

G. Presentations:  In 10 minutes, prepare as a group to present what you did in the last 2 hours. You can open your page 
    and talk about it or you can make slides for the presentation. Each group will have 5 minutes to talk about their work.
